This simulation ran for 1000.000000 seconds.

== THROUGHPUT ==
Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 301
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 301

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 160,867,260
Non aggregated algorithm: 342,168,743
Non aggregated algorithm contended 181,301,483 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 14,883,401 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 15,758,638 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 875,237 more bytes.
This means that there was 16,175 more packets in the non aggregated network.
