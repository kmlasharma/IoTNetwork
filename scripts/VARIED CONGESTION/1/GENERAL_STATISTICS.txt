Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 120
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 120

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 25,719,570
Non aggregated algorithm: 54,754,174
Non aggregated algorithm contended 29,034,604 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 5,937,933 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 6,291,202 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 353,269 more bytes.
This means that there was 6,451 more packets in the non aggregated network.
