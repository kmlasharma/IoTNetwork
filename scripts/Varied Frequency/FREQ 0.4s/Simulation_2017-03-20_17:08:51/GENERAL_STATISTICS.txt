Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 302
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 300

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 31,906,173
Non aggregated algorithm: 84,704,149
Non aggregated algorithm contended 52,797,976 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 7,332,802 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 7,702,099 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 369,297 more bytes.
This means that there was 8,062 more packets in the non aggregated network.
