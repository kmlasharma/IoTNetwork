This simulation ran for 900.000000 seconds.

== THROUGHPUT ==
Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 401
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 401

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 228,622,425
Non aggregated algorithm: 488,907,043
Non aggregated algorithm contended 260,284,618 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 17,595,411 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 18,535,347 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 939,936 more bytes.
This means that there was 19,387 more packets in the non aggregated network.
