Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 81
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 81

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 7,374,550
Non aggregated algorithm: 20,129,612
Non aggregated algorithm contended 12,755,062 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 3,592,105 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 3,778,170 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 186,065 more bytes.
This means that there was 3,830 more packets in the non aggregated network.
