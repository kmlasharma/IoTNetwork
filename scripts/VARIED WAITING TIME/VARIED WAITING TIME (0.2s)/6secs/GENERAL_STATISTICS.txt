This simulation ran for 1000.000000 seconds.

== THROUGHPUT ==
Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 602
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 602

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 638,468,966
Non aggregated algorithm: 1,362,043,723
Non aggregated algorithm contended 723,574,757 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 29,628,615 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 31,372,770 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 1,744,155 more bytes.
This means that there was 32,311 more packets in the non aggregated network.
