Aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 201
Non aggregated algorithm: (Average packets received in 20 seconds) 201

== MEDIUM ACCESS ATTEMPTS ==
Aggregated algorithm: 71,343,892
Non aggregated algorithm: 152,404,896
Non aggregated algorithm contended 81,061,004 more times.

== TOTAL DATA PROCESSED BY SERVER ==
Aggregated algorithm: 9,890,511 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm: 10,451,192 bytes
Non aggregated algorithm made servers process 560,681 more bytes.
This means that there was 10,850 more packets in the non aggregated network.
